# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm
Write a C program to implement the single source shortest path i.e. shortest distance between a source node to all other nodes of a graph using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm. You have to show the complete path from source node to all other nodes and the distance of each path from source.
